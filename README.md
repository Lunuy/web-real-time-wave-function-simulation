# Real time wave function simulation on Web using WebGPU
- Real-time schrodinger equation solving, using finite difference method
- Use isotropic discrete laplacian operator from [ISOTROPIC FINITE DIFFERENCE DISCRETIZATION OF LAPLACIAN OPERATOR](https://mathematicians.korea.ac.kr/cfdkim/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2023/06/ISOTROPIC_FDM.pdf) written by HYUN GEUN LEE, SEOKJUN HAM2, JUNSEOK KIM2.
- But poor convergence

- The wall is teto-textured.
